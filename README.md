# Challenge 06 Server Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description

This project was built to showcase my ability to supply a working Weather Dashboard using the Openweather API. To complete this I was tasked to use knowledge learned in week 6 along with the previous weeks. The main goal of this assignment is to provide a Weather Dashboard that responds to user inputs and shows todays weather and 5 day forecast.

In this project to build a working Current and 5 future days forecast I utilized HTML, CSS, BootStrap CSS Framework, Moment.JS, and JQuery to build a functioning forecasting site that takes a city input by the user, passes that to the OpenWeatherMap.org API (Server Side API) and uses the API's response to build a forecast display for the user. This also uses local storage to store previously stored searchs for that session. beyond the scope of the project I did include a clear list option button for the user.
